# Roadmap

Things that will change and be added in the future in msw-dev-tool
There is no priority for this yet, but I plan to prioritize it given your feedback.
[Please give me feedback!](https://github.com/nayounsang/msw-dev-tool/issues)


1. Separation of packages
I will separate the packages into core and ui.
The core package will be a peer dependency of the ui package.
I'm thinking of names like `@msw-dev-tool/core` and `@msw-dev-tool/react`.
This will hopefully solve the code quality issues and make it possible to use the logic of msw-dev-tool headless.

2. More flexible response customization 
Currently, simple response settings are possible via behavior.
However, I plan to enable more specialized logic setup, such as `add temp handler`.

3. Disable full mocking
With the addition of mock disable to behavior, the disable logic utilizing checkboxes is gone.
I plan to keep this, and make it possible to disable the mock entirely with a switch-like ui.

4. Style isolation
Due to a chronic bug in the UI, the UI style of the existing project and msw-dev-tool conflict.
Currently, a solution to this is being considered.
